# Java-Queues

Overview

In this project, I implemented an unbounded queue and used my queue implementation to list the entries in a directory tree. I also implemented the merge sorting algorithm using queues. I implemented a generic unbounded queue, used a queue and a Java API class to walk a directory tree, implemented a sorting algorithm based upon queues and recursion.
